üìö CS 034 Lab Assignment ‚Äì Chapter 10: Balanced Trees

Title: AVL and Red-Black Tree Analysis and Implementation
Team Size: 2‚Äì3 students per group
Timeline: 1 week
Deliverables: Midpoint Check + Final Submission
üõ†Ô∏è Objective:

Students will work collaboratively to:

    Explore AVL and Red-Black Trees.

    Implement basic AVL and Red-Black Trees in Python.

    Compare performance and balancing operations between the two structures.

    Reflect on design choices through coding, visualization, and analysis.

üìÖ Timeline

Day 7 (Sunday - Final) 	Submit Full Final Project
üßπ Lab Structure
Part 1: AVL Tree Implementation

    Implement a basic AVL Tree class in Python.

    Support insertion with rebalancing (rotations).

    Include tree printing (simple text output or graphic).

    Choose one real-life scenario to model with your AVL Tree:

        Managing player rankings in a competitive video game leaderboard.

        Organizing inventory stock numbers for a warehouse.

        Scheduling patient appointments by appointment ID.

Part 2: Red-Black Tree Implementation

    Implement a Red-Black Tree class in Python.

    Support insertion with recoloring and rotation as needed.

    Include tree printing (simple text output or graphic).

    Choose one real-life scenario to model with your Red-Black Tree:

        Storing and updating book ISBN numbers in a library database.

        Maintaining sorted event timestamps for a server log.

        Managing airline flight numbers for efficient look-up and updates.

Part 3: Comparison and Analysis

    Insert the same set of 20 random integers into both trees.

    Track and report:

        Number of rotations

        Final tree heights

    Summarize key differences observed between the AVL and Red-Black trees.

üìù Midpoint Check (Due Day 4 - Thursday)

Each group must submit:

    Draft code files for AVL Tree insertion (even if incomplete).

    Draft code files for Red-Black Tree insertion (even if incomplete).

    A short 1-page team progress report answering:

        What is working well so far?

        What challenges have you encountered?

        What is your next goal before the final due date?

üõ°Ô∏è Final Submission (Due Day 7 - Sunday)

Each group must submit:

    Completed AVL Tree and Red-Black Tree Python files.

    Screenshots or console output showing both trees after inserting the 20 values.

    A 2‚Äì3 page written reflection including:

        Brief explanation of how your trees rebalance.

        A chart/table showing number of rotations and final heights.

        Lessons learned while building and comparing the two tree types.

üßê Important Reminders:

    Work collaboratively ‚Äî divide tasks, but everyone must understand the final code.

    Comment your code thoroughly.

    If you reuse external code snippets (small allowed with permission), cite clearly.

    Communication and task management are key to your success!
